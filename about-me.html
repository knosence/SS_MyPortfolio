                                    file, but not practical at the moment.

                                    I actually started using CAD software a week

                                    need that i couldn't find, and so I learn
                                    how to make it myself.

                                    boards. I wanted it to be a modular so I
                                    don't have to throw out a whole test bench
                                    just to print a new one with the updates or
                                    upgrades I needed.

                                    There are 32 teams in the NFL, and out of
                                    those 32 teams, I just happen to hate all
                                    but one!

                                    Teams I hope go broke are: pittsburgh
                                    stinkers, cincinnati house cats, cleveland

                                    I was in high school, I played football and
                                    played almost every position, but usually
                                    stick to Running Back, Slot Receiver,
                                    Defensive-end and Outside Linebacker. My
                                    Linebacker coach would hype us up by showing
                                    us Ray Lewis film and Motivational speeches.
                                    I first became a Ray Lewis fan because I
                                    never really looked at football on TV, but I
                                    would always stop and watch one of the
                                    greatest linebackers to play the game (I
                                    will die on this hill).

                                    I was stationed in Camp Pendleton,
                                    California for the majority of my
                                    enlistment. I was deployed twice, one to
                                    Iraq and the other on a Meu, aka the Marine

                                I started here when the company was Dodson
                                Global inc, they had changed their name to Texas
                                Pipe and supply in 2016 which was about the time
                                I became the Assistant Manager and started
                                helping in IT (more about that later). In 2020,
                                I was approached by both Shipping and Receiver
                                Managers about the warehouse Manager position
                                that was closer to my house (20 mins closer
                                actually)....

                                .... As you can tell, I accepted the opportunity
                                but wanted to grow and eventually made a career
                                change to Insurance (adjuster).

                                I helped out with the IT section and installed
                                and removed computer, computer components, and
                                software. I also build my own server lab and
                                could help with the server room..

                            <p>
                                I started Progressive as a Claims Representative
                                and quickly realized that claims was not my cup
                                of tea. I struggled with the concept of you are
                                never behind even if you have 200 claims in your
                                workload, what made things really frustrating is
                                that I can't take extra time to get them sorted
                                out, but this is the norm as all other Claims
                                Representative more experience than me had to
                                juggle more. To give you an understanding of how
                                it was, if you met all of your metrics (which no
                                one meets their metrics, or at least not for
                                long), and manage to keep your claims under 35.
                                One day, when I was searching on indeed, I came
                                across a Skillstorm and dev10 job
                                posting........

                                .... And now that I have you up to speed, I have
                                always wanted to be in Technology, and have when
                                to school for software Development between 2015
                                – 2018, and applied for Dev jobs with no luck. I
                                became disinterested in finding projects and
                                started working on my own with the stack that I
                                wanted to work on. I am definitely glad that I
                                am reproaching this career with my understanding
                                of programming and programming concepts and all
                                the skills that I picked up along the way.
