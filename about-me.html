                                    file, but not practical at the moment.

                                    need that i couldn't find, and so I learn

                                    boards. I wanted it to be a modular so I don't have to throw out a whole test bench just to print a new one with the updates or upgrades I needed.

                                    There are 32 teams in the NFL, and out of
                                    those 32 teams, I just happen to hate all
                                    but one!

                                    Teams I hope go broke are: pittsburgh
                                    stinkers, cincinnati house cats, cleveland
                                    backside butter, tennessee peewee (Not
                                    considered important enough for
                                    capitalization)

                                    I was a football player back in high school.
                                    I played almost every position but usually
                                    played Running Back, Slot Receiver, D-end
                                    and Outside Linebacker. My Linebacker coach
                                    would hype us up by showing us Ray Lewis
                                    film and Motivational. I never really looked
                                    at football on TV, but I would always stop
                                    and watch one of the greatest linebackers to
                                    play the game (I will die on this hill).
